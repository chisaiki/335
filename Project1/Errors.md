## Syntax Errors
``` 
Matrix33::printFunc()
{
    std::cout << "\nPrint Function Called" << std::endl;
}
```
This is wrong because I need to declare the function type before I specify the scope of the function itself

Correct: ``` void Matrix33::printFunc() ```

## Questions:
1. Why do I need a constructor?
   - You need a constructor to initialize your objectâ€™s data members when you create an instance of the class. Constructors set up the initial state of your object, allocate memory if needed, and help prevent bugs from uninitialized variables.

   -  C++ automatically provides a default constructor for you. This is called the compiler-generated default constructor. **It does not initialize member variables**; it just creates the object.

   - However, if you define *any* constructor (even one with parameters), the compiler will not generate a default constructor unless you explicitly declare it. If you want both a custom constructor and a default one, you must define the default constructor yourself.

   - Because I'm writing my own constructors, I need to provide a default one as well, because of the above reason

   ```
   In summary, C++ allows objects to be created without explicit initialization, but it's crucial to understand the implications. Default initialization of built-in types leaves them with indeterminate values, while class types are default-initialized by their constructors. Always strive to initialize objects properly to avoid undefined behavior and potential issues.
